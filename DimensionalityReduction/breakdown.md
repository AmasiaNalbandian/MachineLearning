The first two are clustering algorithms. You can choose your own measures of distance/similarity. Justify your choices.

Clustering
    Expectation Maximization
    Clustering Algorithm of Your Choice

Linear:
    PCA
    ICA
    Randomized Projections

Non-linear: 
    Manifold Learning Algorithm of Your Choice
